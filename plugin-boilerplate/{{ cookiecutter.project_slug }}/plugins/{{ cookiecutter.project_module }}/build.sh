# This file is automatically run by climweb when the plugin is built into a Dockerfile.
# It will also be called when building the plugin in an existing container. You should
# only perform build steps in this script.

# Any install steps that will modify things in climweb's data volume should instead
# be done in the runtime_setup.sh script next to this one. For example running some
# SQL against the embedded postgres database should not be done in this script as it
# makes no sense to do that in a Dockerfile build.

# climweb will automatically install this python module for you so you should not
# repeat any python dependency installation steps here.

# Instead this file is ideal for any other installation custom steps here required by
# your plugin. For example installing a postgres extension used by your plugin.
