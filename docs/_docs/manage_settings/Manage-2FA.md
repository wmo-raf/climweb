# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

## Setting Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in Wagtail

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your Wagtail admin account. It requires both your password and a unique code generated by an authenticator app, making it harder for unauthorized users to access your account.

### Step 1: Log in to the Wagtail Admin Panel

1. Open your web browser and navigate to your Wagtail admin login page.
2. Enter your username and password, then click **Log in**.

### Step 2: Set Up an Authenticator App on your phone

To complete 2FA setup, you will need an authenticator app such as:

- Google Authenticator (Android/iOS)
- Authy (Android/iOS)
- Microsoft Authenticator (Android/iOS)
