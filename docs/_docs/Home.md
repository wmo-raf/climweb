# Introduction

Amidst escalating and urgent impacts of climate change, Africa exhibits major challenges in coping with its
consequences, particularly in terms of controlling extreme weather events, and delivering accurate and timely
information to the public.

In response to these challenges, the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) Regional Office for Africa launched a
Content Management System (ClimWeb) which is a website template, specifically designed to aid the digital transformation of
National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) in Africa

This innovative template, built on **free and open-source standards**, features a modern design, seamless marketing
integrations, a user-friendly weather warnings publisher (in CAP Format) and advanced weather and climate data
visualization tools.

The technical development of the system has been supported by experts seconded
by [NORCAP](https://www.nrc.no/expert-deployment/norcap-who-we-are/) a part of
the [Norwegian Refugee Council](https://www.nrc.no/), with guidance of the WMO Regional Office for Africa.

The technical support provided to NMHSs at the WMO Regional Office for Africa include:

- Focal Points verification and updates for different WMO Programmes including OSCAR Surface, WIGOS, WDQMS and CAP
- [OSCAR Surface](https://oscar.wmo.int/surface/#/about) verification and updates Station Metadata Update
- Data transmission challenges identification, troubleshooting and resolution
- WMO Country Profile Database updates
- Website and Content Management System (ClimWeb) development and support
- CAP Activation and Dissemination
- Social Media Management and communication, Email Marketing and User Data Management

This document provides an overview of the Content Management System (ClimWeb) and its features, the delivery and support.

This new ClimWeb template offers:

- Customisable and modern design
- Seamless marketing integrations
- User-friendly CAP Warnings Composer
- Interactive georeferenced data visualisation for NMHSs weather and climate products, as well as data from external
  sources.

It adopts **best practices in data visualization and hydro meteorological department and climate communications**. All
components of the website are built on free and open-source standards allowing for collaboration and contribution.

The CAP Warnings Composer is expected to **increase the adoption of the Common Alerting Protocol in Africa**, key to
increasing the reach of alerts, and their connectivity to broadcast, web and mobile networks. Africa remains one of the
world's most vulnerable regions to climate change and increasing extremes. Increasing the protection of the population
through improved climate and early warning communications is crucial.

## Considerations during the design & development phase

During the design and development phase, fundamental factors were taken into consideration to ensure the delivery of a
Content Management System that would improve the efficiency of management.

![ClimWeb Features](../_static/images/home/features.jpg "ClimWeb Features")

It factored in:

- Well **defined content structure** and pages management,
- **User-friendly interface** with a modern look and feel
- Great **user experience and ease** in locating content
- A **decentralized ClimWeb architecture** was adopted to allow management of departmental sections by different user roles
  and allow for content moderation and publishing **workflows**

Currently, most of the NMHSs website's management is not decentralized. This means that the website is managed by one
staff, usually from the IT department. This is not very efficient as every department has its own content, but the
content management systems are not user-friendly to allow for easy management of content by different departments. The
new ClimWeb template allows for the management of different sections of the website by different staff, thus removing the
load from the IT department and allowing for more efficient management of the website.

## Delivery and support

For a smooth and efficient delivery of the ClimWeb and customization of the website template to the NMHS, a step by step
process is adopted. The quality and interactivity of the website is first assessed followed by approaching and
presenting the ClimWeb and integrating feedback. Thereafter, willing/potential members for support are identified together
with a focal point for coordination. The ClimWeb is then installed and training on the configuration of ClimWeb and
customization of the website conducted. Additionally, learning materials, documentations and guides are provided
alongside follow-up support in troubleshooting
