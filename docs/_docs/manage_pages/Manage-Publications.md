## Publication thumbnail autogeneration

If your publication is a PDF, the thumbnail can be automatically generated from the first page of the PDF. This means
you don't need to manually upload a thumbnail image for the publication, unless you want to use a custom image and not
the first page of the PDF.

![Publication Thumbnail Autogeneration](../../_static/images/publications/thumbnail_autogeneration.png "Publication Thumbnail Autogeneration")

```{note}
This feature is currently only available for PDF files. If you upload a non-PDF file, you will need to manually upload a thumbnail image.
