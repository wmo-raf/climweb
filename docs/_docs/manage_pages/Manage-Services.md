## Creation of Services

The creation of services follows the steps below:

1. Create a service category
2. Create a service listing page
3. Create a service page

## Service Creation Example Scenario

Assume you would like to have Agrometeorology Service on the website, the practical way to do it using the steps above would be:

### Step 1: Create an 'Agromet Service Category'

To create a service, navigate to the 'Snippets' section on the explorer menu and select 'Servies Categories' as below:

![Services Explorer](../../_static/images/products/services_explorer.png "Services Explorer")

Click on 'Add service category' to create a new service.

Provide service category name and choose an icon and save.

### Step 2: Create a Service Listing page

A listing page is a page that holds a list of pages. For example, a Service Listing page would hold an agrometeorology service page, weather forecasting page, etc.

![Services List Preview](../../_static/images/services/service_list_preview.png "Services List Preview")

To create this page navigate to the 'pages' item on the explorer menu as shown below and click on the pages item at the top.
