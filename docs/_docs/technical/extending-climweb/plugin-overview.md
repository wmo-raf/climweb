# Plugin Overview

ClimWeb Plugins are custom Wagtail apps that extend the functionality of ClimWeb. They can be used to add new features,
modify existing ones, or integrate with external services.

Some examples of what you can do with a Climweb plugin are:

- Add new country specific modules, for example for data processing, payments integration etc.
- Add new page types that are not available in the core Climweb installation.
- Integrate with 3rd party APIs or software
- Install custom postgres extensions, system packages, python dependencies
- And much more!

## Important Notes on Plugins

- You should always make backups of your Climweb data before installing and using any plugin.
- You should only ever install plugins from a trusted source
- Ensure that you fully understand the plugins you are installing and using, as this entirely at your own risk.

In this guide we dive into how to create a Climweb plugin, discuss the plugin architecture and give you sample
plugins to get inspiration from.
