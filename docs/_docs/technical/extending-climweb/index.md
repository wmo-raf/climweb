# Extending Climweb

At the base, Climweb provides a generic, well researched and tested content structure that addresses most of the
needs of the NMHSs, in providing a functional and user-friendly website. This structure is designed to be flexible and
extensible, allowing for easy addition of services and products provided by the NMHSs.

However, the needs of each NMHSs may vary, and some may require additional features or customizations to meet their
specific requirements. To address this, ClimWeb can be extended by creating new modules, that we call `Plugins`, which
can then be integrated into the system.

These plugins can be used to add new features, modify existing functionality, or integrate with external systems.
These can be developed by third-party developers, allowing for a wide range of customization options.
