# Generating PNG/PDF

A PNG and PDF version of a published CAP is generated automatically after publishing an alert.

![CAP PNG PDF](../../_static/images/cap/create_png_pdf.png "CAP PNG PDF")

The links to view/download the PNG and PDF files are available on the published CAP detail page

![CAP PNG PDF Links](../../_static/images/cap/view_png_pdf.png "CAP PNG PDF Links")

If for some reason the PNG or PDF files are not generated, you can manually trigger the generation by clicking the "
Create PNG/PDF" button on the Admin page of the CAP.

![CAP Create PNG PDF](../../_static/images/cap/cap_create_png_pdf_button.png "CAP Create PNG PDF")

```{note}
The `Create PNG/PDF` button is only available for CAPs that have been published. If the CAP is not published, the
button will not be visible.
