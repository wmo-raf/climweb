# Alertwise (CAP Alerts)


The **Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)** provides an open, non-proprietary digital message format for all types of alerts
and notifications. It does not address any particular application or telecommunications method. The CAP format is
compatible with emerging techniques, such as Web services, as well as existing formats including the Specific Area
Message Encoding (SAME) used for the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio
and the Emergency Alert System (EAS)

The CAP xml response follows the structure of the schema provided at
http://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/cap/v1.2/CAP-v1.2-os.html
