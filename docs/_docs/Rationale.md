# Rationale

## Supporting the achievement of WMOâ€™s Long Term Goals and implementation of flagship initiatives in Africa

- To cover everyone on earth with early warnings by 2027
- Supporting the Global Multi-hazard Alert System (GMAS) for Africa
- Digital transformation of NMHSs in the region

In February 2023, the eighteenth session of the Regional Association I (RA I) took note of the recommendation from the
Regional Conference on the emerging needs of NMHSs in Africa on digital transformation and requested
in [Decision 13 (RA I-18)](https://library.wmo.int/viewer/57803/?offset=1#page=56&viewer=picture&o=bookmark&n=0&q=) the
Secretary-General and Technical Commissions to support regional activities to close the gaps in the region. In this
context, thereafter, **the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Regional Office for Africa developed a Content
Management System (ClimWeb) as a website template specifically designed to aid the digital transformation of National
Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) in Africa.**
